# Drowsiness-Detection-System

This project implements a real-time drowsiness detection system using Python, OpenCV, Dlib, and facial landmarks. The system tracks facial features, specifically eye movements, to classify the userâ€™s state as Active, Drowsy, or Sleeping. 

This can be used in applications like driver fatigue monitoring and workplace safety systems.

How It Works

    Face Detection: Uses Dlib's pre-trained face detector to locate faces in the video frame.
    Landmark Detection: Detects 68 facial landmarks to pinpoint eye positions.
    Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR): Calculates the ratio of vertical to horizontal distances of eye landmarks to determine the eye's state.
    Status Classification:
    Sleeping: Eyes closed for a prolonged duration.
    Drowsy: Partially closed eyes detected consistently.
    Active: Eyes open and blinking normally.


Technologies Used

    OpenCV: For image processing and video capture.
    Dlib: For face detection and facial landmark identification.
    Numpy: For efficient numerical computations.
    Imutils: For additional image processing utilities.
